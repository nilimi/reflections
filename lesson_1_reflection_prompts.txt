How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was able to find a typo in the new version that wasn’t in the old.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You could pinpoint changes made that had undesirable effects.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    With manual commits, you won’t save changes before you are ready, but you may forget.  Automatic commits will not  be dependent on your memory, but may save changes you do not want.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Some types of files do not need to be grouped together like picture
    edits or docs.  Coding often is reliant on more than one file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log wil show all the commits
	git diff will show the differences betweene the commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You might be more willing to experiment if you can recover.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Any projects with code that I don't mind sharing since I dont have a 
    paid account and do not have the option of making projects private
