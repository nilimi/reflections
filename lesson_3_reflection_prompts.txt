When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  You might want to use a remote repository when you expect to use multiple machines or wish to share with other users.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	A fork clones a repository into your Github that is independent of the original repository.  You would fork when you want your own copy of a repository to modify.  Clone pulls a repository to your local machine.  You would clone when you want a local copy, most likely to edit.  Branches are different versions of the project that are still a part of the repository.  You would branch when you want to make changes to a project that you expect to merge or remain a part of the project.
